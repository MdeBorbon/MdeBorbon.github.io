I research complex differential geometry and geometric analysis.
I did my PhD at Imperial College London under the supervision of
Simon Donaldson.
My PhD thesis is available [HERE](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/31373).

I am a member of the [Geometry Group](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/geometry) at King's College London.

I co-organize the [KCL Geometry Seminar](https://mdeborbon.github.io/kcl-geometry-seminar/).
