I research complex differential geometry and geometric analysis.
I did my PhD at Imperial College London under the supervision of
Simon Donaldson.
My PhD thesis is available [HERE](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/31373).

I am a postdoc at [UT Dallas](https://math.utdallas.edu/research/) working with [Ronan Conlon](https://profiles.utdallas.edu/ronan.conlon)
